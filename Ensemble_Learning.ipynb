This randomness ensures that each tree in the forest learns different patterns and becomes less correlated with other trees. As a result, the model becomes more diverse, reduces overfitting, and improves prediction accuracy. By forcing each tree to rely on different feature combinations, Random Forest becomes more robust and performs better than a single decision tree or simple bagging."

During training, each decision tree is built using a bootstrap sample, meaning it randomly selects data points with replacement.

After the tree is trained, it predicts the output for its OOB samples, and this process is repeated for every tree in the forest. By combining these OOB predictions for all data points, the Random Forest calculates an OOB score, which acts like a built-in test accuracy.\n",

The reduction in impurity is credited to the feature. Then these reductions are summed (and often normalized) across all trees.\n",

For each feature individually: you randomly shuffle its values across samples (keeping all other features unchanged), then compute model performance (e.g. accuracy for classification, R² or MSE for regression). The drop in performance (compared to baseline) is a measure of how important that feature was.\n",

After training the bagging model, we measure its accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix on unseen test data to check how well it generalizes. If OOB sampling is enabled, the model can also estimate performance without a separate test set by predicting the out-of-bag samples left out during bootstrap sampling. This OOB score serves as a reliable measure of accuracy. Additionally, cross-validation can be used to evaluate stability and reduce bias. Together, these evaluation methods help determine whether the Bagging Classifier is accurate, robust, and less prone to overfitting."

After all models are trained independently, they each make a prediction for the same input, and the Bagging Regressor combines these outputs by taking the average of all predictions. This averaging reduces the variance of the model, makes the final prediction more stable, and prevents overfitting compared to a single regressor.
